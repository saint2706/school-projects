# School Computer Science Projects

This repository is a collection of computer science projects created by students. The projects have been refactored and modernized to follow best practices.

## Getting Started

To run these projects, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the required libraries.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   pip

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Projects

To run a project, simply execute the corresponding Python script from your terminal:

```bash
python <filename.py>
```

For example, to run the Blackjack game:

pip install pytest
```

Then, run the test suite from the root of the repository:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```

## Continuous Integration

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on every push and pull request. This ensures that all changes are validated and that the codebase remains stable.
