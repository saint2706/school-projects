# Refactored Poker Game

This is a refactored version of the Texas Hold'em poker game. The code has been restructured into a more modular and object-oriented design.

## Project Structure

*   `main.py`: The main entry point for the game.
*   `game.py`: Contains the `Game` class, which manages the game flow.
*   `player.py`: Contains the `Player` class, which manages a player's state.
*   `deck.py`: Contains the `Deck` and `Card` classes.
*   `hand_evaluator.py`: Contains the logic for evaluating a poker hand.

## How to Run

To run the game, execute the `main.py` script from the root of the `poker` directory:

```bash
python -m poker.main
```
